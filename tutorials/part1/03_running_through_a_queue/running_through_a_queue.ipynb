    "\n",
    "The simplest way to execute jobs through a queue would be to write a templated queue file and then submit it as a two-task Firework, as in the Firetask tutorial. However, FireWorks then considers your “job” to only be queue submission, and will consider the job completed after the queue submission is complete. FireWorks will not know when the actual payload starts running, or is finished, or if the job finishes successfully. Thus, many of the useful management and monitoring features of FireWorks will not be available to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more powerful way to execute jobs through a queue is presented in this tutorial. In this method, the queue file runs rlaunch instead of running your desired program. This method is just like typing rlaunch into a Terminal window like in the core tutorials, except that now we are submitting a queue script that does the typing for us (it’s very low-tech!). In particular, FireWorks is completely unaware that you are running through a queue!\n",
    "\n",
    "The jobs we will submit to the queue are basically placeholder jobs that are asleep until the job starts running. When the job is actually assigned computer resources and runs, the script “wakes” up and runs the Rocket Launcher, which then figures out what Firework to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of this low-tech system is that it is quite durable; if your queue system goes down or you delete a job from the queue, there are zero repercussions. You don’t have to tell FireWorks to run those jobs somewhere else, because FireWorks never knew about your queue in the first place. In addition, if you are running on multiple machines and the queue becomes backlogged on one of them, it does not matter at all. Your submission job stuck in the queue is not preventing high-priority jobs from running on other machines.\n",

    "## Launch jobs\n",

    "This submission procedure is already configured in this tutorial and you just need to issue the ```qlaunch``` command.\n",
